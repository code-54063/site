# Learn code

Welcome to the **Code as literacy, commodity, infrastructure** webpage!

You can find the materials and activities for each week in the menu on the left along with useful information to get you started. 

We'll go through these exercises in class but you might need to do some follow up work outside of class if you can't complete in time. The materials are divided in four major parts:

1. **Getting started** If you don't know where to start, begin here. 
2. **Understanding Python** One of the most widely used and supported programming languages in the world.
3. **Web scraping with Python** An introduction into the world of scraping
4. **Django** Django is a framework, built with Python. It is an incredibly powerful framework.  Instagram, Spotify, Youtube were built using it!
