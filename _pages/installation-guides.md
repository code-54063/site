A quick guide on how to install pip and Beautiful Soup.

## Windows

### Pip 

If you download Python 3.5 you should have pip installed as a default when you install python. The most important thing is to make sure it's updated.

On Windows, type this in the command line:

```
python -m pip install -U pip
```

### Beautiful Soup

In the command line, navigate to your python directory (e.g. my python directory is `C:/Python/Python35-32`).

Once in that directory type the following and press enter:

```
easy_install BeautifulSoup4
```

So the screenÂ will look like:

> C:/Python/Python35-32>easy_install BeautifulSoup4

## Mac
