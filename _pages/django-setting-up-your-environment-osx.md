*Please refer to command line basics for an introduction to navigating files using the command line.*

Open up your terminal (for example, press Apple Key + Space and type `terminal`).

Find out where your terminal is located by typing `ls`.

Go to your Desktop by entering `cd Desktop`.

Create a folder by typing `mkdir djangogirls`.

Look at your desktop- is the folder there?

Enter the folder: `cd djangogirls`.

Firstly, install virtualenv: `pip install virtualenv`.

Check that it installed by running: `virtualenv --version`.

In this location, create a virtual environment (the folder will be called `myvenv`): `python3 -m venv myvenv`.
