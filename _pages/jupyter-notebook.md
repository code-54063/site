## Cloudstor

![cloudstor-logo.png](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/pwXdzeYzcZPxqw9/download)

**Cloudstor** is a "file sharing and cloud storage solution for the research and education sector" (more information [here](https://www.aarnet.edu.au/network-and-services/cloud-services-applications/cloudstor)) offered by Australiaâ€™s Academic and Research Network (AARNet).

Basically, cloudstor is a service like Dropbox as it allows to store files online and optionally sync a folder located on your computer and all its files. 

UTS students (and staff) have access to the service (you also get out of the box 1TB of cloud storage).
  

To access cloudstor, you need to

1. Point your browser to [cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/);

2. Login with your UTS credentials by selecting your institution (you need to search for "University of Technology Sydney" and not "UTS");

3. Accept the "Terms And Conditions Of Service" (don't worry, they won't sell your data - it's a not-for-profit service funded by the Australian government!).

If you want to take advantage of all the features offered by cloudstor --  including automatically syncing files located on your computer, you can have a look at [this guide](https://support.aarnet.edu.au/hc/en-us/articles/227469547-CloudStor-Getting-Started-Guide).
