In this section you will find six quick tutorials. The documents are static, if you want to use them interactively (so changing and running the Python code), you will need to download the `.ipynb` files  (you can download the all the files at once from [here](https://code.research.uts.edu.au/143852/code-as-literacy-jupyter-notebooks/-/archive/master/code-as-literacy-jupyter-notebooks-master.zip)), upload them in your [cloudstor](http://www.dsmcode.com/getting-started/jupyter-notebook#cloudstor) and run them with [SWAN](http://www.dsmcode.com/getting-started/jupyter-notebook#cloudstor--jupyter-notebook--swan).

We suggest to complete the tutorials in this order:

1. [Introduction](/understanding-python/introduction)
2. [Why is coding so hard?(/understanding-python/why-is-so-hard)
3. [Decision structures and boolean logic](/understanding-python/decisions-and-logic)
4. [Repetition structures](/understanding-python/repetition)
5. [Functions](/understanding-python/functions)
6. [Object-oriented programming](/understanding-python/object-oriented-programming)

If you have any issue with the code (or you think you know enough to help others) have a look at the conversation on Teams, where to channels are dedicated to [installation issues](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a769484749865406984d5d97a4bf7d25c%40thread.skype/Coding%2520issues?groupId=6b2b6609-a95b-40a2-8570-91455f3f78ba&tenantId=e8911c26-cf9f-4a9c-878e-527807be8791) and [coding issues](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a769484749865406984d5d97a4bf7d25c%40thread.skype/Coding%2520issues?groupId=6b2b6609-a95b-40a2-8570-91455f3f78ba&tenantId=e8911c26-cf9f-4a9c-878e-527807be8791).
