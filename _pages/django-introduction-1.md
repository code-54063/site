Hi everyone,

Welcome to your first coding workshop!

This week we're going to do some basic coding with python and start to get familiar with some of the basic principles of programming.

We'd like to thank Yianni Conomos for preparing this guide and for [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/)who offer their python tutorial under a [creative commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). We made some minor amendments to the tutorial and also added in our own sections on databases and website scraping.
