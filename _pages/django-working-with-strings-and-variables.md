## Working with Strings

Type: `'Alice' + 'Bob'` into IDLE and press Enter.

`+` now is a **string concatenation** operator, **concatenation** just means linking.

Type: `'Alice' + 2` and press Enter. Then type:

``` python
print (‘I am ’ + str(29) + ‘ years old’)
```

and press Enter

**What do you think str() does? **

Type the following and press enter after each one:

``` python
spam = 40
spam
spam = 42
spam
```

Spam is a **variable**.
