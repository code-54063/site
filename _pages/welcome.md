**Hi everyone, welcome to Code as Literacy, Commodity, Infrastructure.**

In this subject you will learn how to do some basic coding and work with code to do some cool things. You will need to bring a laptop with you in classes to complete most activities.

**Please contact us ASAP if you need a laptop for thisÂ subject, we will be able to source a laptop for you.**


## Subject online resources

There are multiple online resources prepared for this subject:

1. **[UTS Online](https://online.uts.edu.au)** where you can find, among others, details about weekly readings and assignments.
2. **DSMCode.com** (this website) where you find materials and instructions related to coding.
3. **[GitLab](https://code.research.uts.edu.au/143852/code-as-literacy-jupyter-notebooks/tree/master)**  where you can download the notebooks that you can interactively execute in your CloudStor with SWAN.
4.**Microsoft Teams** where you find two dedicated channels to solving issues with [installation](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3ab3c25b4281a940fb83a636837df86469%40thread.skype/Installation%2520issues?groupId=6b2b6609-a95b-40a2-8570-91455f3f78ba&tenantId=e8911c26-cf9f-4a9c-878e-527807be8791) and [coding](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a769484749865406984d5d97a4bf7d25c%40thread.skype/Coding%2520issues?groupId=6b2b6609-a95b-40a2-8570-91455f3f78ba&tenantId=e8911c26-cf9f-4a9c-878e-527807be8791) (you will quickly find help, but you can also help others!).

## What you need to do to get ready

To truly benefit from this subject you will need to participate actively in class but also **online** and **on your own computer**.

### Before week 2

The first thing that you will need to do is to download the Python interactive notebooks from [here](https://code.research.uts.edu.au/143852/code-as-literacy-jupyter-notebooks/-/archive/master/code-as-literacy-jupyter-notebooks-master.zip) and upload them in your own CloudStor. [This page]() will help you to understand how to do it.

### Before week 3

The most interesting coding activities will require that you install a Python distribution (we strongly suggest Anaconda) on your own computer. [This page]() will help you to understand how to do it.

## What you can do to get even readier

### If you are unfamiliar with coding

We recommend that you have a look at [this python-specific program](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/welcome/an-hour-of-code). But you can complete another tutorial if that looks more interesting to you. You can see other examples [here](https://code.org/learn).

### Get familiar with the command line

If you are a Mac user: Spend some time playing around with the command line in Terminal and test out some of the commands in [this tutorial](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/09/a-command-line-primer-for-beginners/).

If you use PC: Read through [this tutorial](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) and experiment with the command line.
