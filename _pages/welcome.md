**Hi everyone, welcome to Code as Literacy, Commodity, Infrastructure.**

In this subject you will learn how to do some basic coding and work with code to do some cool things. You will need to bring a laptop with you in classes to complete most activities.

**Please contact us ASAP if you need a laptop for this subject, we will be able to source a laptop for you.**

To prepare for the semester ahead, you need to complete the following tasks in Week 1. *You will not be able to effectively participate in Week 2 tutorials if you don't do these tasks*.

## 1. You need to install the following programs to be able to complete participate in class activities. One Week 1 task is to install these applications onto a laptop. You need to install these programs in order.

### Install Python 3.5.0

Download the Mac or Windows version of python (whichever is relevant for your OS) from this [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-350/).

Relevant tutorial guides can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9_u93Nekqw) (Windows) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZ6FlHBQiCU).

### Move Python Directory (Windows Only)

You need to move the major folder that contains Python to your `C:/`

Search your computer to find the folder and drag it to your `C:/` (where Program Files etc. is).

or if you are confident go into IDLE and type:

```
 import sys
 print(sys.path)
 ```

This will show you where Python is located.

My python folder was found in `C:/Users/\[UserName\]/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python35-32`.

### Check Python is installed into PATH (Windows Only)

Open the [command prompt](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/7-ways-launch-command-prompt-windows-7-windows-8). Don't worry about changing directories. Just type in python and press enter. Python should open. If it doesn't, don't stress just make a note of it for now.

### Install Sublime Text 3

Download it [here](https://www.sublimetext.com/3).

## 2. If you are unfamiliar with coding, practice an Hour of Code

We recommend [this python-specific program](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/welcome/an-hour-of-code) but you can complete another tutorial if that looks more interesting to you. You can see other examples [here](https://code.org/learn).

## 3. Get familiar with the command line

If you are a Mac user: Spend some time playing around with the command line in Terminal and test out some of the commands in [this tutorial](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/09/a-command-line-primer-for-beginners/).

If you use PC: Read through [this tutorial](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) and experiment with the command line.

## 4. We are also going to be holding a few impromptu extra coding workshops every so often for people who want to get even more coding practice (and have some fun!).

The first one is an introduction to using and programming a SPRK+ Sphero (an actual robot) at the UTS Library. Places are limited to 35 students and you can sign up [here](http://www.lib.uts.edu.au/event/696945/54063-code-literacy-commodity-infrastructure-introduction-to-sphero-workshop).
