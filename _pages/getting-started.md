## What you need to do to get ready

To truly benefit from this subject you will need to participate actively in class but also **online** and **on your own computer**.

### Before week 2

The first thing that you will need to do is to download the Python interactive notebooks from [here](https://code.research.uts.edu.au/143852/code-as-literacy-jupyter-notebooks/-/archive/master/code-as-literacy-jupyter-notebooks-master.zip) and upload them in your own CloudStor (the notebook files are in a subfolder and end with `.ipynb`). [This page](/getting-started/jupyter-notebook) will help you to understand how to do it.

### Before week 3

The most interesting coding activities will require that you install a Python distribution (we strongly suggest Anaconda) on your own computer. [This page](/getting-started/anaconda) will help you to understand how to do it.

## What you can do to get even readier

### If you are unfamiliar with coding

We recommend that you have a look at [this python-specific program](https://hourofpython.trinket.io/a-visual-introduction-to-python#/welcome/an-hour-of-code). But you can complete another tutorial if that looks more interesting to you. You can see other examples [here](https://code.org/learn).

If you are really interested in coding, we recommend that you complete this tutorial on Lynda.com: [Learning Python](https://www.lynda.com/Python-tutorials/Learning-Python/661773-2.html?org=uts.edu.au).

### Get familiar with the command line

If you are a Mac user: Spend some time playing around with the command line in Terminal and test out some of the commands in [this tutorial](https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2010/09/a-command-line-primer-for-beginners/).

If you use PC: Read through [this tutorial](http://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands) and experiment with the command line.
