## Code editor 

Now we're finally going to start writing some code!

Firstly, you'll need to install a code editor.


You might be wondering why we are installing this special code editor software, rather than using something like Word or Notepad.

The first reason is that code needs to be plain text, and the problem with programs like Word and Textedit is that they don't actually produce plain text, they produce rich text (with fonts and formatting), using custom formats like [RTF (Rich Text Format)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Text_Format).

The second reason is that code editors are specialized for editing code, so they can provide helpful features like highlighting code with color according to its meaning, or automatically closing quotes for you.

**If you have installed Anaconda, you should probably use [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which include their own editor (among many other features)**.

### Sublime Text 3

Sublime Text is a very popular editor with a free evaluation period. It's easy to install and use, and it's available for all operating systems.
