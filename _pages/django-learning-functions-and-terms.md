## Adding numbers and learning names

To start off let's do some basic sums in IDLE and learn some programming terminology:

Type `2 + 2` into IDLE and press Enter

It should look like this:

> 2 + 2
>
> 4

Python can do maths. Programmers also have weird terms for what we just did.

* `2 + 2` is an **expression**

* `2` is an **integer value **

* `+` is an **operator**

* `2 + 2` is **evaluated down** to one integer.

You won't be tested on these terms but they are useful to know.

Python can also work with letters as well as numbers. Programmers refer to numbers and letters in different ways:

**Integers**: -1, -1, 0, 1, 5, 100

**Floating-point numbers**: -1.25, -1.0, 0.0, 4.0.

**Strings**: 'a',  'aa',  'cats',  'Alice', 'Bob'.
