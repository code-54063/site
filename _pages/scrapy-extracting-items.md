There are several ways to extract data from web pages. Scrapy uses a mechanism based on [XPath](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath) expressions called [XPath
selectors](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.16/topics/selectors.html#topics-selectors). For more information about selectors and other extraction
mechanisms see the [XPath selectors documentation](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/0.16/topics/selectors.html#topics-selectors).
