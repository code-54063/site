## Preparation

### Installing Python 3 and Accessing IDLE

Before you come to this class make sure you have Python 3 installed. You can download Python 3 for free from python.org [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Soon we are going to access python from the command line (either [terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)) for Mac or [cmd.exe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cmd.exe) for PC) but for now let's open IDLE, Python's **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment and **L**earning **E**nvironment.

You can find it here:

#### Windows
```
python \> lib \> idlelib \> idle
```

####  Mac
In a MacPython 3 folder in your Applications folder.
