After each exercise we will discuss how different people worked out their answers and compare results.

## Exercise 1

Write a program that asks the user for their name but only greets them with their name if they are Alice or Bob.

## Exercise 2

Define a function `max()`. Then write a program that allows two numbers to be inputted and returns the larger number.

You might find the comparison operators on [this list](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm) useful. It is also a good resource for python operators more generally. You should also use the if-else construct. (Drawn from R4meau).

## Exercise 3

Define a function `max_of_three()`. Write a program that accepts *three* numbers as inputs and returns the largest of them.

## Extension: Exercise 4

Write a program that tells you whether a letter is a vowel or not. Think about using variables, lists and True/False.
